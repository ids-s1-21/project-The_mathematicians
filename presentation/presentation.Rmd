## Overall goal & research question

We will be investigating certain beliefs of students towards Mathematics using multiple sub questions:.  

--

1. How are answers distributed between students in different schools?

   (e.g. School of Mathematics vs. School of Informatics)

--

2. Are there any correlations between answers/groups of answers?

   (e.g. whether some combinations of answers to different questions are more likely to be chosen simultaneously)

--

3. How do the answers of students differ from expected answers (answers from experts)?  


---

# Our dats sets

The result of an anonymous survey regarding "Beliefs about Mathematics" which was completed by students of the University of Edinburgh for the academic year 2019-2020 (Data set obtained from Dr. George Kinnear).  

--
  - 32 questions in total (One filter question whose mark doesn't count)
  
  - We also use data sets containing gender, schools and the experts' answers for each question.


---


# Processing data

Before we perform analysis, we need to transfer answers such as "Agree", "Disagree" to numeric answers. There are two methods (we considered) of doing this:  

--

  1. Each student will get 1 mark for answering the question at the same direction as the experts (e.g. "Agree" and "Strongly Agree" is at the same direction as "Agree") and 0 otherwise. 
  
--
  
  2. For questions of which expected answers are "Agree", we could give marks for "Strongly Agree", "Agree", "Neutral", "Disagree" and "Strongly Disagree" as follows: 2, 1, 0, -1, -2. Vice versa.  

---

# Method decision

--

We decided to use the first method because:  

--

As the answer from the experts comes in only two variants ("agree" and ""disagree"), and we cannot know to what degree they actually agree with a choice like the one that's been given to the students (So it doesn't make sense that "Strongly Agree" necessarily earns more marks than "Agree").

# Analysis results

---

# How do the answers of students differ from the expected answers?

--

- Based on the first method of converting categorical answers to numeric ones, we generated an "expert-like score" by calculating the sum of mark for each student to show how their answers differ from the expected answers.

--

- Then, from the results, we generated a bar chart showing the number of students in each mark (0 to 31) and a histogram showing the number of people in each percentage of marks.

# Categorising questions

Questions are divided into a number of categories* listed below:  

--

- Persistence in Problem Solving: Questions No.8, 10, 24, 29  

- Growth Mindset (Students' belief about whether mathematical ability is innate or can be developed.): Question No.5, 6, 22, 31  

- Interest in Mathematics: Question No.12, 26, 32  

- Relationship between Mathematics and Real World: Question No.13, 15, 21  

- Sense Making (Whether students care about sense making in problem solving): Question No.3, 4, 11, 18, 23 

- Nature of the Answers (Students' views on the nature of solutions to mathematics problems): Question No.2, 7, 9, 16, 28, 30  

- No category: Question No.25, 27

# Testing linearity

--

We tested the linear correlation between different categories and generate a pearson correlation coefficient for each pair of categories.

--

It turned out that there is no strong linear correlation (Coefficient < 0.4).

--

```{r table-for-analysis3-linearity, echo = FALSE}
not_finish_list <- responses_numeric1_filtered %>%
  filter(is.na(answer) == TRUE) 
not_finish_list <- as_tibble(unique(not_finish_list$anon_id))
not_finish_list <- not_finish_list %>%
  rename(anon_id = value)

responses_part2 <- anti_join(responses_numeric1_filtered, not_finish_list, by = "anon_id")

responses_summary_part2 <- responses_part2 %>%
  filter(qnum != 19) %>%
  group_by(anon_id, category) %>%
  summarise(sum_category_mark = sum(mark), .groups = "keep")

responses_summary_part2 <- responses_summary_part2 %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = category, values_from = sum_category_mark)
correlation_matrix <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 8, nrow = 8))
rownames(correlation_matrix) <- colnames(responses_summary_part2[2:9])
colnames(correlation_matrix) <- colnames(responses_summary_part2[2:9])
for (i in 1:8) {
  for (j in 1:8) {
    x <- responses_summary_part2[i + 1]
    y <- responses_summary_part2[j + 1]
    correlation_matrix[i, j] <- cor(x, y, method = "pearson")
  }
}

correlation_matrix <- correlation_matrix %>%
  select(-c("no_category"))
correlation_matrix <- correlation_matrix[-c(5),]

kable(correlation_matrix, format = "html")
```

# Logistic Regression 

Therefore, we decided to use a logistic regression to find stronger correlation.  
We sum up the marks in different categories for each student and we decided that for categories as dependent variables, the mark for each student would be 1 if the mark is higher than a certain number (We called it critical number), otherwise it will be 0.

--

Critical Number are shown as follows:  

  - Confidence in Mathematics: 2
  
  - Persistence in Problem Solving: 2 
  
  - Growth Mindset: 2 
  
  - Interest in Mathematics: 1
  
  - Relationship between Mathematics and Real World: 1 
  
  - Sense Making: 2  
  
  - Nature of the Answers: 3  


---

# Logistic Regression

Then we fit a model for each pair of the categories and calculate the AUC for each model fitted.

```{r table-for-analysis3-logistic, echo = FALSE}
kable(roc_matrix, format = "html")

```

In this table, rows represent dependent variables and columns represent independent variables.  

We can see that the AUC when interest is the dependent variable and confidence is the independent variable is 0.8321314, which is the highest in the table So we will take a look at the model.

---

# Interest ~ Confidence Model

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

- You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.
