## Overall goal & research question

We will be investigating certain beliefs of students towards Mathematics using multiple sub questions:.  

--

1. How are answers distributed between students in different schools?

   (e.g. School of Mathematics vs. School of Informatics)

--

2. Are there any correlations between answers/groups of answers?

   (e.g. whether some combinations of answers to different questions are more likely to be chosen simultaneously)

--

3. How do the answers of students differ from expected answers (answers from experts)?  


---

# Our dats sets

The result of an anonymous survey regarding "Beliefs about Mathematics" which was completed by students of the University of Edinburgh for the academic year 2019-2020 (Data set obtained from Dr. George Kinnear).  

--
  - 32 questions in total (One filter question whose mark doesn't count)
  
  - We also use data sets containing gender, schools and the experts' answers for each question.


---


# Processing data

Before we perform analysis, we need to transfer answers such as "Agree", "Disagree" to numeric answers. There are two methods (we considered) of doing this:  

--

  1. Each student will get 1 mark for answering the question at the same direction as the experts (e.g. "Agree" and "Strongly Agree" is at the same direction as "Agree") and 0 otherwise. 
  
--
  
  2. For questions of which expected answers are "Agree", we could give marks for "Strongly Agree", "Agree", "Neutral", "Disagree" and "Strongly Disagree" as follows: 2, 1, 0, -1, -2. Vice versa.  

---

# Method decision

We decided to use the first method because:  

--

As the answer from the experts comes in only two variants ("agree" and ""disagree"), and we cannot know to what degree they actually agree with a choice like the one that's been given to the students (So it doesn't make sense that "Strongly Agree" necessarily earns more marks than "Agree").

class: inverse, middle, center

# Analysis results

---

# How do the answers of students differ from the expected answers?

- Based on the first method of converting categorical answers to numeric ones, we generated an "expert-like score" by calculating the sum of mark for each student to show how their answers differ from the expected answers.

--

- Then, from the results, we generated a bar chart showing the number of students in each mark (0 to 31) and a histogram showing the number of people in each percentage of marks.

# Graph for "expert-like scores" distribution

```{r plot-for-analysis-I, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.height = "80%", out.width = "60%"}

- <span style="color:red">54.7%</span> of students obtained a mark in range 21-27, which is <span style="color:red">67.7%-87.1%</span> of marks (Relatively high level of correspondence with experts.

You can use plain text

- or bullet points

.pull-left[
or text in two columns $^*$
]
.pull-right[
- like

.footnote[

# Code

```{r boring-regression}
# a boring regression
model <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
tidy(model)
glance(model)
```

---

# Plots

```{r recode-species, echo = FALSE}
# In this chunk I'm doing a bunch of analysis that I don't want to present 
# in my slides. But I need the resulting data frame for a plot I want to present.
iris_modified <- iris %>%
  mutate(Species = fct_other(Species, keep = "setosa"))
```

```{r plot-iris, echo = FALSE}
# Code hidden with echo = FALSE
# Uses modified iris dataset from previous chunk
# Play around with height and width until you're happy with the look
ggplot(data = iris_modified, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal() # theme options: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html
```

---

## Plot and text

.pull-left[
- Some text
- goes here
]
.pull-right[
```{r warning=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.width=4, echo=FALSE}
# see how I changed out.width and fig.width from defaults
# to make the figure bigger
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = species, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal()
```
]

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r iris-table, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(iris), format = "html")
```

---

# Images

```{r castle, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Image credit: Photo by JÃ¶rg Angeli on Unsplash."}
include_graphics("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1535448033526-c0e85c9e6968?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1650&q=80")
```

Or you can also include a full page image. See next slide.

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.
