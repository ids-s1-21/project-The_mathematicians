Students’ Beliefs about Mathematics
================
by The Mathematicians

## Summary

We conduct the project because we want to investigate students’ beliefs
about mathematics. And in detail, we want to research into the following
questions:  
1. How are answers distributed between students in different schools &
genders?  
2. Are there any correlation between answers?  
3. How do the answers of students differ from expected answers?

The data we used to analyse comes from an anonymous survey regarding
“Beliefs about Mathematics” which was completed by students of the
University of Edinburgh for the academic year 2019-2020. The survey has
32 questions (one of them is a filter question, so only 31 questions
actually investigates the beliefs of students) We mainly used three data
sets during the analysis. They are results of the survey, gender, and
the experts’ answers for each question. All these data sets are
anonymous and each student is given an anonymous ID.

For the first question, our analysis shows that, first of all, the
average number of “correct answers” (answers that are in the same
direction as the experts’ answer) ranked by schools is shown as
followed: - School of Mathematics (22.7)  
- School of Physics and Astronomy (21.8)  
- School of Informatics (20.5)  
- School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Science (19.8)  
- School of Economics (18.6)

Also, if we consider questions individually, we found that the rate of
correctness for each question follows a pattern that’s similar to all
schools. It means that although the overall average marks are different,
schools tend to do better/worse on similar questions.  
When it comes to gender, first of all, we found that the overall average
marks for males and females are very close (male: 21 vs. female: 20.9).
However, if we consider questions individually, we found that females
answered better in questions related to “Nature of the Answers” (Whether
answers to mathematical questions are just numbers or reveals deeper
concepts) while males answered better in questions related to
“Persistence in Problem Solving”.

Write-up of your project and findings go here. Think of this as the text
of your presentation. The length should be roughly 5 minutes when read
out loud. Although pacing varies, a 5-minute speech is roughly 750
words. To use the word count addin, select the text you want to count
the words of (probably this is the Summary section of this document, go
to Addins, and select the `Word count` addin). This addin counts words
using two different algorithms, but the results should be similar and as
long as you’re in the ballpark of 750 words, you’re good! The addin will
ignore code chunks and only count the words in prose.

You can also load your data here and present any analysis results /
plots, but I strongly urge you to keep that to a minimum (maybe only the
most important graphic, if you have one you can choose). And make sure
to hide your code with `echo = FALSE` unless the point you are trying to
make is about the code itself. Your results with proper output and
graphics go in your presentation, this space is for a brief summary of
your project.
