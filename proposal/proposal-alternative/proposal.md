## 1. Introduction

This data analysis is based on the research project of Dr. George
Kinnear (which is also where we get our data). The data is collected
from an anonymous survey about “beliefs about mathematics” which is done
by students in the School of Mathematics (including both students in the
School of Mathematics or have School of Mathematics as their second
school) of the University of Edinburgh in 2019/20.

Our research aims at investigating the beliefs of students toward
mathematics. There are serveral sub-questions, which include: 1. How
answers are distributed between students in different schools
(e.g. School of Mathematics vs. School of Informatics)? 2. Are there any
correlations between answers (e.g. whether two answers are more likely
to be chosen simultaneously)? 3. What are the general attitudes of all
students toward mathematics? 4. How is the answers from students differ
from expected answers?

There are 2 raw data which is needed to be processed. Each of them
contains different cases and variables. 1. responses\_joined (Main data
to be analysed) The cases are surveys filled by each student.There are
677 cases. There are 37 variables, these include: - The unique ID
generated for each survey filled by student - The date when student
completed the survey - The school which the student belong to - The
gender of the student - The answers of student to each question (32
questions in total) 2. maps\_questions\_processed.csv Each question
would be a case. There are 32 cases in total. There are 5 variables in
total, they are: - `...1`: The ID for each question automatically
generated by R - `raw`: The raw information of the question, including
question number and text - `qnum`: Question number - `expected_ans`:
Expected answer for the question - `qtext`: The descriptive text of the
question

## 3. Data analysis plan

-   Variables: Multiple outcome (y) and predictor (x) variables are
    needed.

-   Exploratory data analysis

1.  Rename the columns: The columns in responses\_joined are the
    descriptive text of the question, which is very long and hard to
    type. Therefore, changing their names to shorter words would make
    the analysis later easier.

``` r
new_col <- c()
for (i in 3:35){
  question_num <- as.character(i - 3)
  new_title <- paste("Q", question_num, sep = "")
  new_col = c(new_col, new_title)
}

names(responses_joined)[3:35] <- new_col
```

Now the names of columns indicating the answers to questions are changed
to question number. (Q0 is a question that asks students to provide
consent)

2.  Remove data without consent The answer from students who refused to
    give consent will not be collected. Therefore, “NAs” are shown on
    their answers to each question. As a result, we need to remove these
    data, leaving only those with valid answers.

``` r
responses_joined <- responses_joined %>%
  filter(Q0 != "No, I do not consent")
```

3.  Number of agrees for each question It’s good to take a quick look at
    how many agrees are there for each question. This could help us
    judge whether there is any pattern for answers to distribute.

``` r
responses_joined %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = all_of(new_col), names_to = "question", values_to = "answer") %>%
  group_by(question) %>%
  summarise(agrees = sum(answer %in% c("Strongly Agree", "Agree"), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(agrees))
```

    ## # A tibble: 33 × 2
    ##    question agrees
    ##    <chr>     <int>
    ##  1 Q19         543
    ##  2 Q12         490
    ##  3 Q11         480
    ##  4 Q15         446
    ##  5 Q25         446
    ##  6 Q6          426
    ##  7 Q20         387
    ##  8 Q13         337
    ##  9 Q29         185
    ## 10 Q22         135
    ## # … with 23 more rows

4.  Number of students in different schools. By checking the number of
    students in different schools, we are able to get some knowledge on
    the reliability of our results. This is because if a school has a
    very small sample size, then the conclusion about this school
    generated from these samples may not be reliable.

``` r
responses_joined %>%
  group_by(programme_school_name) %>%
  summarise(student_number = n()) %>%
  filter(is.na(programme_school_name) == FALSE) %>%
  arrange(desc(student_number))
```

    ## # A tibble: 16 × 2
    ##    programme_school_name                                  student_number

-   Statistical methods: In order to analyse the correlation between
    answers, we may need to implement some linearity test and
    correlation analysis. These may include using linear regression
    models and pearson r correlation test dependent on the situation.
    Although these contents are not covered yet, with some self-study
    it’s possible for us to use them in our data analysis.

Also, we need to transfer qualitative data to quantitative data (change
answers like “Strongly agree”, “agree” to corresponding marks) and
perform calculation on mean, standard deviation etc in order to get the
distribution of the data.
